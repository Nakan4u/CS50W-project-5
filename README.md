# personal-spa

A single-page personal website application built using React and Django. Final assessment of HarvardX's [Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-web-programming-with-python-and-javascript) course. 

The purpose this activity was to not only put together a personal website for my various freelance project, but also to get a handle with React (which I am using here for the first time).

Aymeric Augustin's [blog post](https://fractalideas.com/blog/making-react-and-django-play-well-together-single-page-app-model/) about setting up CORS in a Django/React apps was very helpful!
